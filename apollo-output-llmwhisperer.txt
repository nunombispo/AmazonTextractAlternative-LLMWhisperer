          The overall summary of reliability and quality status on those items of flight hardware
          which have been designated for the Apollo-Saturn 201 Mission appears in Figure 3-4.
          The measurement yardstick used as a base is derived from the phased program ele-
         ments of NPC 500-5, "Apollo Reliability and Quality Assurance Program Plan" (2).
